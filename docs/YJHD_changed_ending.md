# Int. aditi's room - night
Aditi notices a pile of suitcases. Her eyes move up and find Avi. She smiles.
## Aditi
Wasn't sure you'd come. 
## Avi
Me too... but you'd never let me live it down if I missed your wedding.


<span class="comment"> the difference starts now </span>
Someone shouts Aditi's name. She starts to goes out of the room.
## Aditi

# ext. wedding - night

Aditi opens Avi's eyes to reveal Bunny
## Aditi
Look who I brought here for you

Avi's expression immediately stiffens. He tries to play it cool but is visibly irritated.
## Bunny
Hey Avi.

Aditi goes in front of Avi and leans on Bunny. She laughs.
## aditi
Told you, didn't I? He'll die from shock.
## Bunny
What were you expecting, that I'll miss Aditi's suicide?
## Avi
Nope. I was sure of it. 

Avi hesitantly Hugs Bunny.

## Avi 
What a surprise, man.

Avi starts pouring drinks.
## Avi
His face looks stupid, but he drives a BMW.
## Aditi
Shut up, Avi.

Aditi looks to Bunny. she says while blushing.
## Aditi
Tarun is very intelligent and sweet and loves me a lot.
## Avi
Basically, he's a pet.
## Bunny
Avi, how's the restaurant going?
<span class="comment"> here is where the discrepency starts </span>

## Avi
It's uh- Okay...
## Aditi
bunny, how long is the trip?
## Bunny
I'll leave on the night of your wedding. I'll be leaving for Paris.

There is a pause.
## Avi
You don't live in Chicago anymore?
## Bunny 
That was just at the start. Then New york, then Hawaii the-

Avi cuts him
## avi
Dude you keep moving around, I got confused.
## Bunny
I'll uh- go and take a shower.
## avi
Aren't gonna go home?
## Bunny
Not this time...
## Avi
Come on guys, let's do something together like old times.

Avi starts laughing
## Avi
Like old times my ass. Other than our faces nothing has remained the same.
## Bunny
Nothing ever changes between friends, avi.
## Avi
It doesn't. But see, we aren't friends anymore, Bunny.
#### Cut to:

# ext. wedding - night
Bunny is seen walking with his blazer around his shoulder. He looks, and he sees Naina call him. She has her legs dipped in water.

Camera cuts to Bunny trying to put his legs in the water.
## Bunny
Damn, it's cold.

Naina laughs
## Naina
It's water, It's gonna be okay in a while.

Bunny completely submerges his feet in the water.
## Bunny
Married yet?
## Naina
What? Nope.
## Bunny
And kids? 
## Naina
Yes. Three.

Naina laughs. 
## Naina 
Why do you ask?
## Bunny
Nothing, just wanted to ask if I should hold back or flirt without hesitation.

Naina giggles.
<span class="comment"> This part is not in the original </span>

They look at the sky.
## Bunny
It's beautiful isn't it? The sky. The stars.
## Naina
Yeah.
## bunny
Don't you feel like leaving all of this behind? 
## Naina
I've done that once, remember? It was hell explaining everything to my parents. Although why would you keep doing it again and again, I never understood that.
## bunny
Its... the same issue that's with love. It suffocates you and just... feels like you're gonna be betrayed by the peace at some point.
## Naina
Sounds like someone has commitment issues.

Naina and Bunny giggle
## Bunny
Hey, no personal attacks, dude.

They pause.
## Bunny
You've changed quite a bit- You actually look happy now.
## Naina
It's because I am. I hope you find it too.

# Ext. lawns - morning

Bunny is carrying a bag and a suitcase for someone. 

## Bunny
### (whispers)
Am I your dad's servant?

Bunny glances at Avi. He's gambling with a group. He loses. He is also seen drinking. ==Avi starts to look dizzy==. The phone Bunny took, chimes.

Bunny looks at the phone and it is a message that reads "Ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga". Bunny smiles.

Enact the rest of the chase scene as it is.

<span class="comment"> This part occurs before in the original movie </span>
# int aditi's room - Morning
Avi is in the room, and Aditi comes in.
## Aditi
Hey. Uh I'll check which room is available, you hadn't sent the rsvp, so this is a bit tricky
## Avi
I'm sorry about that... I'm fine at the moment.

Avi is seen opening a bottle and drinking out of it.

## Aditi
Avi, it's time to sleep now, you're still drinking?
## Avi
It's nothing much...
## Aditi
Anyways uh.. What happened to the Bar deal?
## Avi
What always happens... it sank. The investors said they couldn't bear the loss. All that bar needs is a little renovation... Anyway, never mind.

## Aditi
Never mind? How much money do you need?
## Avi
200 crores. Do you have it?!

Bunny enters the frame.
## Bunny
What's going on?
## Avi
Nothing.
## Aditi
Avi! 
## Bunny
Why’d you lie, Avi? You could’ve told me about the bar.
## Avi
### (sarcastically)
Oh, sure. Like you care, Mr. Traveler. Too busy filming sunsets to notice anything.

## Aditi
Avi, stop it. We’re not here to fight with you. We’re here because we care.

Avi laughs bitterly.
## Avi
Care? Do you think care is going to rebuild my bar? Or fix the fact that I’m drowning in debt? Or stop people from calling me a failure?

Bunny steps forward.
## Bunny  
No, care isn’t going to fix it. But sitting here drinking yourself to death and gambling your life away isn't gonna fix it either.
## Aditi  
Avi, we’re not saying it’s going to be easy. But you’ve got to try. You’re not the kind of guy who gives up.

Avi looks at Aditi.
## Avi
### (Slightly louder voice)  
What do you know about giving up, Aditi? You got your perfect life, your oh-so-perfect fiancé! Your life is sorted.

Aditi looks hurt. 
## Aditi
Do you think my life just fell into place? I worked for it, Avi. Just like you used to work for your dreams. Where’s that guy, huh? Where’s the Avi who poured his everything into that bar?

Bunny interjects
## Bunny
She’s right. You built that place from scratch, man. It’s not the investors or the economy that sank the bar—it’s you. You gave up on it before anyone else did.

Avi stares at Bunny
## Avi  
What the hell do you know about it? I can't fly away from my problems like you. You’ve been gone for years now, Bunny. Don’t come back and act like you understand.

Bunny steps closer.
## Bunny
### (Angry)
I know enough to see that you’re better than this. You want to sit here and throw a pity party, fine. But that bar doesn’t need those "200 crores". It needs you to stop gambling, stop drinking, and actually give a _try_.

Bunny uses his hands to make quotation marks when he says "200 crores"
## Aditi
### (softly)  
Avi, you’ve started to break. I see you struggle to stay away from alcohol. The same with gambling.

Avi sits down on the couch. 
## Avi
### (cracking voice)  
And what if I do try, huh? What when it doesn't work out?

Bunny puts a hand on Avi's shoulder.
## Bunny
Then at least you’ll know you fought for it. You don't need to prove anyone anything. We just can't watch you to keep sabotaging yourself.
## Aditi
Avi, please. Just say yes.
## Avi
### (voice cracking more)
I- Uh- Fine... I'll (sighs) try.

Aditi and Bunny smile.
## Aditi  
One step at a time, Avi. We’re here for you.

Avi looks at them, finally letting a small, reluctant smile slide in.

_Aditi exhales in relief, and Bunny pats Avi on the back._

####  Cut to:

Enact the Udaipur trip of Naina and Bunny as it is. 
The next scene where Avi is gambling doesn't occur. 

# Ext. pond - night
Naina is seen with her feet in the water. She is touching the water with her hand as well. Bunny is seen holding two bottles of beer and tries to approach her.
VIKRAM enters the frame and is seen holding two bottles of a drink too.

## VIkram
Hey.
## Naina
Hi.
## VIkram 
I got us some drinks. Considering you called me at this time, I thought the conversation might last long,

Bunny looks disappointed and sad. He leaves. 

#### Cut to:
Play the shot of Aditi's Vidai.
Play the scene where Bunny returns to his home. 

# INT. AVI’S BAR - Morning

The bar is bustling with activity. There are workers sanding the wood, painting the walls and fixing the lights. There is a sound of some off-screen hammering and drilling.
Avi is in the middle and is looking at the bar. He looks prideful. 

Aditi and Naina walk into the bar.

## Aditi
### (grinning)  
Wow, Avi. It’s actually coming together really well.
## Avi
That sarcasm definitely doesn't suit the person who was berating me that day.

Avi smiles
## Avi 
Anyways, it’s not done yet. There’s still much to fix.

Naina steps closer
## Naina 
You should be proud, Avi. It’s not easy to rebuild something you thought you’d lost.

Avi looks at them.
## Avi
### (quieter)  
Yeah… It’s been hard. But it had to be done. For myself at least.
## Aditi
Finally. That’s the Avi we know.

_Avi chuckles, shaking his head._
## Avi
You know, Naina, you and Aditi are like the motivational speakers I never asked for.
## Naina
### (laughs)  
Hey, someone gotta keep you in check.

## Aditi
### (sounds serious, mockingly)  
And you better not mess it up. We want this place to be so good that you'll be having to stop people at the door.

Avi smirks.
## Avi  
I’ll keep that in mind. Maybe I'll reserve a table for you guys.
## Bunny (Off screen)
Oh, we’ll be expecting free drinks as well.

Bunny is seen entering the frame.
All laugh.
## Bunny
Hi Avi.
## Avi
Hey.

Avi pauses, and pours a shot for everyone.
## Avi
Thanks, guys. For everything. This one is to you guys.

They clink their glasses together.
## Naina
Always, Avi.

Everyone finishes it in one shot. 
## Aditi
### (grinning)  
Now stop getting sentimental and get back to work. 

_Avi shakes his head, laughing._

Avi pours another shot into everyone's glasses.
## Bunny
### (playfully)
Hey! You promised to limit yourself, and you're bringing us into limitless drinking as well?

Avi smiles.
## Avi
Just this one time, guys. To our future!

Everyone smiles. 
Bunny is seen looking at the group. He smiles. His phone chimes. It is a reminder of his flight in four hours.
We see him say goodbye to the group and opens the door.

Cut to a black screen as he closes the door.
##### The End.
